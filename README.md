# AI-Powered Writeups for Next-Gen Underwriting

Introduce Case here. 
A good solution would provide complimentary assistance to an underwriter without biasing what is produced. A tool that collates and produces summaries as well as visualization on the findings whilst allowing the underwriter to ultimately decide what is relevant to them conveying their proposal more efficiently. 

Options for visualizations to use across different data points that the UW can quickly select rather than manually produce. 

Summarizations of relevant sections of the contract or changes YoY that provides a base for the UW to build on top of. 

Profiling of customers with respect to market segments / perils 

Macroeconomic factors which could have consequences on proposal. Stability of proposal currency etc 
What is the current problem? 

There are time consuming, repetitive tasks which place constraints on underwriter (UW) time during renewal period. We want to free up UW time by automating away the boring stuff, allowing them to write more business or focus on more complex submissions. 

Examples of tasks which could be automated: 

Summarizing contract clauses/changes which justify proposal. 

Presenting tabular data from Revo in final report. UWs currently screenshot tables from Revo and paste in final report. When data changes, this needs to be updated. 

Text summary of key movements YoY. 

Producing charts/visualizations from Revo data. UW copy data into excel and create plots manually in excel. These plots are then copied into final report. 

Text summary of foreign exchange movements and subsequent impact on proposal. 

Cat modelling specifications: date, version, portfolios 

Provide narrative on whether the modelling aligns with exposure/experience data. 

Legislative changes which are relevant to the proposal. 



SC. Who are the users of this solution? 

Underwriters 

 

## Expected Outcome:

Software that complements the UWâ€™s process. UW still decide whether to: 

Summary of contractual changes YoY and impacts on the proposal. 

Profiling of the of cedant. Notable news articles regarding company, org structure changes, strategy changes etc. Summary of current exposures on lines of business 

Summary of macro-economic impacts on contract. How volatile is the currency? Is inflation stable in contract currency? 

Include layer details from current/previous year from Revo. 

Include visuals of key movements. 

Summary of cat modelling details 

Some UW reports we saw included: modelling date, version, YoY changes in TIV and AAL. 

Legislation changes which are pertinent to the proposal.
